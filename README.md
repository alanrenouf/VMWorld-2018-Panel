## Session Abstract:

The IT industry is pushing to adapt automation. For VMware environments, there has been a strong push to using API calls, particularly RESTful APIs. Once a vSphere administrator understands what interacting with an API entails, the question becomes - how does this make my life easier? Ansible is one of the tools to come out in the last years that is easy to pickup and is able to deliver on the promise of immutable infrastructure and infrastructure control as code.

However, the fact is that Ansible is an open source project, with a 3rd party support structure. VMware supports the APIs, but sadly it's very difficult to extend support to customers using a 3rd party tool to interact with them. The Ansible community has made available several modules, but most were built using Python SDK interactions and last tested on vSphere 5.5, and some of them are still in "preview" mode. The modern way of using Ansible and vSphere is with HTTP/S calls to the RESTful API, and that has it's own set of limitations.
